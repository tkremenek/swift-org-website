title: 'Introducing Packages on Swift.org'

Today, Swift.org gains a useful, new [top-level Packages page](https://www.swift.org/packages).

The page provides a streamlined entry to exploring the Swift package ecosystem. It has common categories like [server](https://swift.org/packages/server), [networking](https://swift.org/packages/networking), [testing](https://swift.org/packages/testing), and [logging](https://swift.org/packages/logging), as well as categories of interest like [packages containing macros](https://swift.org/packages/macros). When you select a category, it provides a sample of some widely-used packages for that category, with information to help you explore further. Itâ€™s a great way to get a sense of the variety of packages available for Swift.

_The package lists give you relevant information at a glance._

The package lists are powered by the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/), thanks to the [sponsorship and support of Apple](https://www.swift.org/blog/swift-package-index-developer-spotlight/).

## Community Showcase

In addition to finding common categories of packages, you can also browse new and interesting work from across the Swift package ecosystem with the [Community Showcase](https://swift.org/packages/showcase).

The Community Showcase contains a rotating selection of packages being discussed by the Swift community. Anyone can nominate a package in [this forum thread](https://example.com/thread/not/posted/yet), and nominations will be reviewed monthly by the [Swift Website Workgroup](https://www.swift.org/website-workgroup/).

The new [Packages page](https://www.swift.org/packages) is an exciting step in growing a valuable and thriving package ecosystem for the benefit of all Swift developers.
